                <h3>Comprehensive Dental Care</h3>
                <p>A complete and comprehensive dental exam will be performed by your dentist at your initial dental visit. At regular check-up exams, your dentist and hygienist will perform the following; </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Examination of diagnostic x-rays (radiographs):essential for detection of decay, tumors, cysts and bone loss. X-rays also help determine tooth and root positions. </li>
                    <li>Oral cancer screening: check the face, neck, lips, tongue, throat, tissues and gums for any sign of oral cancer</li>
                    <li>Gum disease evaluation: Check the gums and bone around the teeth for any signs of periodontal disease </li>
                    <li>Examination of tooth decay: all tooth surfaces will be checked for decay with special dental instruments</li>
                    <li>Examination of existing restorations: Check current fillings, crowns, etc. </li>

                    <h3>Digital X-Rays</h3>
                    <p>Digital radiography (x-ray) is the latest technology used to take dental x-rays. This technique uses an electronic sensor instead of x-ray film, that captures and stores the digital image on a computer. This image can be instantly viewed and enlarged, helping your dentist and dental hygienist detect problems more easily. Digital x-rays reduce radiation 80-90% compared to the already low exposure of traditional dental x-rays. </p>
                    <p>Dental x-rays are essential, preventative, diagnostic tools that provide valuable information not visible during a regular dental exam. Dentists and dental hygienists use this information to safely and accurately detect hidden dental abnormalities and complete an accurate treatment plan. Without x-rays, problem areas may go undetected. </p>

                <h3>Root Canal Treatment</h3>
                <p>Root canal treatment is an often straight forward procedure to relieve dental pain and save your teeth. </p>

                <p>Patients typically need a root canal when there is inflammation or infection in the roots of a tooth. During root canal treatment, an endodontist who specializes in such treatment carefully removes the pulp inside the tooth, cleans, disinfects and shapes the root canals, and places a filling to seal the space.</p>

                    <h3>How do I know I need root canal treatment?</h3>
                    <p>During the early stages of infection, pain may be minimal or even non-existent. As the infection develops, you may get pain or swelling.</p>
                    <p>When there are no symptoms, the infection may only be visible to your dentist on examination.</p>
                    <p>In these situations, the dentist would normally see a small spot or opening on the gum (called a sinus tract) where the infection has created a path to come out of the bone. Sometimes the dentist can also see a shadow at the bottom of the root on the x-ray.</p>
